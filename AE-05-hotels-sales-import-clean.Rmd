# Exercises

## Exercise 1

Write a line of code to read in the `hotels.csv` dataset from the `data` folder in your project directory.

```{r load-data, message = FALSE}

```

## Exercise 2

Remove `eval = FALSE`, knit the document, and view the following visualization.

```{r plot, fig.width=10, eval = FALSE}
hotels %>%
  group_by(hotel, arrival_date_month) %>%   # group by hotel type and arrival month
  summarise(mean_adr = mean(adr)) %>%       # calculate mean adr for each group
  ggplot(aes(
    x = arrival_date_month,                 # x-axis = arrival_date_month
    y = mean_adr,                           # y-axis = mean_adr calculated above
    group = hotel,                          # group lines by hotel type
    color = hotel)                          # and color by hotel type
    ) +
  geom_line() +                             # use lines to represent data
  theme_minimal() +                         # use a minimal theme
  labs(x = "Arrival month",                 # customize labels
       y = "Mean ADR (average daily rate)",
       title = "Comparison of resort and city hotel prices across months",
       subtitle = "Resort hotel prices soar in the summer while ciry hotel prices remain relatively constant throughout the year",
       color = "Hotel type")
```

How are the months ordered?

> YOUR ANSWER HERE

What would be a better order?

> YOUR ANSWER HERE

Reorder the months on the x-axis (levels of `arrival_date_month`) in a way that makes more sense.
You will want to use a function from the **forcats** package, see <https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html> for inspiration and help.

```{r label-me-1}
# add code for reordering the months
```

## Exercise 3

Use the `hotels` dataset to create two separate dataframes, one for City Hotels and one for Resort Hotels.

```{r label-me-2}
# add code for s
```

Write these two dataframes to new csv files. Place them in the data folder in your project directory.

```{r label-me-3}
# add code for writing out the two data frames here
```

## Exercise 4

Read in the Excel file called `sales.xlsx` from the `data/` folder such that it looks like the following. Note you may need to load a new package - you should add this to the `load-pkg` code chunk at the top of the document. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="20%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sales-1.png")
```

```{r label-me-4}

```

# Stretch Goals

If you finish the above exercises before time is up, try out the following two stretch goals.

1. Manipulate the sales data in Exercise 4 such such that it looks like the following.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sales-2.png")
```

```{r label-me-5}

```

2. Recreate the plot from Exercise 2 but change the y-axis label so the values are shown with dollar signs, e.g. $80 instead of 80.
You will want to use a function from the **scales** package, see <https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/index.html> for inspiration and help.

```{r label-me-6}

```

# Submission

To submit, you need to export your .html document from RStudio Cloud and then upload it to the AE 05 assignment on Canvas. Refer back to [Lab 01](https://kgfitzgerald.github.io/APU_MATH_250/labs/lab-01-hello-r.html) for detailed instructions on how to export and submit your assignment. 

# Grading (10 pts)
 
Application exercises are graded on completion. You will receive full credit if you turn in the .html on time and a reasonable attempt was made on each exercise.
